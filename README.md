# Old Kekmet

## As of now, development on individual projects has been stopped in favour of one big mod, [GoodOldMSC](<https://akatsuki.nekoweb.org/project/goodoldmsc>).

Old Kekmet is a My Summer Car mod that reverts the Kekmet in many ways to old behaviour.

It's latest version can be downloaded [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/4866?tab=files)
